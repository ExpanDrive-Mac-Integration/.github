## What is ExpanDrive for Mac?

ExpanDrive is a powerful cloud storage client for macOS that lets you access remote files as if they were on your local machine. It supports all major cloud providers including Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, OneDrive, and SFTP servers.  

With ExpanDrive, you can work directly from applications like Adobe Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, or Visual Studio Code without downloading files first. The software mounts cloud storage as a network drive, offering seamless integration with Finder and full support for macOS features like Quick Look and Spotlight search.  

ExpanDrive uses advanced caching and compression to ensure fast read/write speeds, even with large files. Built-in encryption keeps your data secure during transfer. Whether you're a developer, designer, or creative professional, ExpanDrive simplifies cloud file management on Mac.
